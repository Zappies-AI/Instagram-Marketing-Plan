    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals (Grays, Indigo) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dashboard-style SPA featuring a top navigation for key sections (Overview, Schedule, Pillars, Highlights). The core is an interactive weekly/daily schedule where users can click on a day to view its specific tasks in a dynamic content area. This structure breaks down the dense 30-day plan into manageable, non-linear chunks, making it more of a tool than a static document. A chart provides a visual summary of content distribution, enhancing the dashboard feel. The new Highlights section provides a dedicated overview of the highlight strategy, including creative names and content descriptions, making this crucial element of Instagram strategy easily digestible. This was chosen to transform the static report into a usable, interactive tool for daily reference, which directly addresses the user's goal of making the content easily consumable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Core Strategy & Pillars -> Goal: Inform -> Viz/Presentation: Styled HTML cards with icons -> Interaction: Static display -> Justification: Clear, scannable presentation of core concepts -> Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind.
        - Report Info: 30-Day Schedule -> Goal: Organize/Interact -> Viz/Presentation: Tabbed weeks with clickable day cards -> Interaction: JS-powered content display on click -> Justification: Prevents information overload by showing one day at a time, making the plan actionable -> Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind/JS.
        - Report Info: Content Volume (derived) -> Goal: Compare/Inform -> Viz/Presentation: Bar Chart -> Interaction: Dynamic rendering with tooltips -> Justification: Provides a high-level visual summary of the content effort distribution, adding a data-driven element to the dashboard -> Library/Method: Chart.js/Canvas.
        - Report Info: Instagram Highlights Strategy -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz/Presentation: Styled HTML cards with creative names and descriptions -> Interaction: Static display -> Justification: Provides a dedicated, easy-to-reference section for a key Instagram feature, enhancing the overall strategic overview -> Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind.
